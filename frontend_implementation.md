# Frontend Implementation Guide for AI-Enhanced Crypto Wallet

## Overview
This guide outlines how to implement a frontend application that integrates with the AI-Enhanced Crypto Wallet backend. The frontend should provide users with portfolio analytics, risk notifications, asset research, scam detection, and conversational AI features.

## Tech Stack Recommendations
- **Framework**: React.js or Next.js
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit or React Context API
- **UI Components**: Material-UI, Chakra UI, or Tailwind CSS
- **API Client**: Axios or React Query
- **Authentication**: JWT with local storage or cookies
- **Blockchain Interaction**: ethers.js or web3.js
- **Charts**: recharts or Chart.js
- **Forms**: Formik or React Hook Form

## API Integration Points

### Base URL
```
BASE_URL = 'https://api.your-deployed-backend.com' # For production
BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000' # For local development
```

### Endpoints

#### Portfolio
- `GET ${BASE_URL}/portfolio/performance?user_id={user_id}`
  - Fetches portfolio performance metrics
  - Response includes performance data, asset allocation, and historical values

- `GET ${BASE_URL}/portfolio/{user_id}`
  - Fetches the full portfolio with real-time prices
  - Response includes list of assets with current prices and balances

- `GET ${BASE_URL}/portfolio/price/{token_address}`
  - Fetches the price of a specific token
  - Response includes token address and current USD price

#### Risk Notifications (To be implemented)
- `POST ${BASE_URL}/notifications/risk`
  - Subscribe to risk alerts for specific assets
  - Required payload: `{ user_id: string, asset_ids: string[], threshold: number }`

#### Asset Research (To be implemented)
- `GET ${BASE_URL}/assets/{id}/summary`
  - Get detailed research on a crypto asset
  - Response includes fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and AI insights

#### Scam Detection (To be implemented)
- `POST ${BASE_URL}/security/check-address`
  - Check if an address is potentially malicious
  - Required payload: `{ address: string, network: string }`

#### Conversational AI (To be implemented)
- `POST ${BASE_URL}/assistant/message`
  - Send a message to the AI assistant
  - Required payload: `{ user_id: string, message: string, context?: object }`

## Authentication Flow
1. User registers/logs in through frontend
2. Backend validates credentials and returns a JWT
3. Frontend stores JWT in localStorage or secure cookie
4. Frontend includes JWT in Authorization header for all API requests
5. Frontend handles token expiration and refreshes when needed

## Component Structure
```
