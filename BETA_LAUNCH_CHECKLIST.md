### Testing Phases
1. **Internal Testing (1 week)**
   - Team members test all agents with diverse questions
   - Focus on response quality and accuracy

2. **Closed Beta (2 weeks)**
   - Limited external users (10-20)
   - Daily check-ins and feedback collection
   - Tune agent responses based on feedback

3. **Open Beta (3-4 weeks)**
   - Expanded user base (50-100)
   - Weekly refinements to agents
   - Performance optimization

### Metrics to Track
- Response quality ratings
- Average response time
- User satisfaction scores
- Query patterns and common questions
- Token usage and costs

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered in production:

1. **Quick Fixes**
   - For minor issues, deploy fixes directly to production

2. **Rollback Procedure**
   - For major issues, execute rollback to previous stable version
   ```bash
   # Stop current deployment
   docker stop salt-wallet
   
   # Start previous version (replace X.Y.Z with last stable version)
   docker run -d \
     --name salt-wallet \
     -p 8000:8000 \
     -e DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL" \
     -e GEMINI_API_KEY="$GEMINI_API_KEY" \
     -e PORT="8000" \
     -e HOST="0.0.0.0" \
     salt-wallet:X.Y.Z
   ```

3. **Communication Plan**
   - Notify all beta users of issues and status
   - Provide estimated resolution timeline
   - Document incidents and resolution for future reference
