   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key
   ```

3. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 7777
   ```

### 2. Agno UI Setup

   ```bash
   npx create-agent-ui@latest crypto-research-ui
   cd crypto-research-ui
   ```

2. **Configure backend endpoint**:
   Edit the configuration to point to your backend:
   ```
   Backend URL: http://localhost:7777
   ```

3. **Start Agno UI**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Analyze the current DeFi landscape and TVL trends"
    }
  ],

  "user_id": "user-123"
}
```

### 3. Social Sentiment Analysis
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What's the social sentiment around SOL and ADA tokens?"
    }
  ],
  "session_id": "sentiment-analysis-1",
  "user_id": "user-123"
}
```

## Research Capabilities

The agent can perform the following types of research:

### 1. **News Aggregation**
- Scrapes major crypto news sources
- Filters content based on user queries
- Provides sourced information with links

### 2. **DeFi Protocol Analysis**
- Gathers data from DeFiLlama, DexScreener
- Analyzes TVL, yield farming opportunities
- Tracks protocol performance metrics

### 3. **Social Sentiment Tracking**
- Monitors social media mentions
- Analyzes sentiment for specific tokens
- Provides community insights

## Response Format

The agent provides structured responses with:

- **Research Status**: Real-time updates during data gathering
- **Source Attribution**: Clear citation of all data sources
- **Timestamp**: When the research was conducted
- **Categorized Data**: Organized by news, DeFi, sentiment
- **Analysis**: AI-powered insights and recommendations

## Example Streaming Response

```
üîç Starting comprehensive market research...

‚úÖ Research complete! Gathered 5 news sources, 3 DeFi sources, and 2 sentiment sources.

## Bitcoin Market Analysis

Based on recent data from CoinDesk and Cointelegraph:
- Current price action showing...
- Institutional sentiment remains...
- Technical indicators suggest...

*Sources: CoinDesk, Cointelegraph (scraped at 2024-01-15 14:30 UTC)*
```

## Error Handling

The agent gracefully handles various error conditions:

- **Missing API Keys**: Clear error messages when Firecrawl/Gemini keys are missing
- **Scraping Failures**: Continues research with available sources
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements delays and retry logic
- **Data Parsing**: Fallback mechanisms for malformed data

## Performance Optimization

- **Concurrent Scraping**: Multiple sources scraped in parallel
- **Content Filtering**: Relevant content extraction to reduce noise
- **Response Caching**: Implements caching for frequently requested data
- **Streaming Updates**: Real-time progress feedback to users

## Customization Options

### 1. **Custom News Sources**
Modify the `search_crypto_news` method to add custom sources:
```python
sources = [
    "https://your-custom-source.com",
    "https://another-source.com"
]
```

### 2. **Research Parameters**
Adjust research depth and scope:
```python
# Increase/decrease number of sources
news_data = await self.firecrawl_service.search_crypto_news(query, max_sources=10)
```

### 3. **Content Filtering**
Customize content relevance filtering:
```python
# Add custom keywords for filtering
if any(keyword in content.lower() for keyword in custom_keywords):
    # Include in results
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY not found"**
   - Ensure API key is set in `.env` file
   - Restart the backend server after adding the key

2. **"Scraping failed"**
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Verify Firecrawl API key is valid
   - Check if target websites are accessible

3. **Slow response times**
   - Reduce number of sources being scraped
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Consider using async optimization

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:
```python
agent = get_agent(
    agent_id="firecrawl_research",
    debug_mode=True
)
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the research agent:

1. **Advanced Filtering**: ML-based content relevance scoring
2. **Data Persistence**: Store research results for historical analysis
3. **Custom Dashboards**: Specialized views for different research types
4. **Real-time Alerts**: Notification system for significant market events
5. **Multi-language Support**: International news sources and analysis
